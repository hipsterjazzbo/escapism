# Escapism

Sometimes, you just want to play Minecraft with a little extra.

This pack has a lot to offer, but tries to keep a Minecraft feel. Everything is done through game mechanics, and there are no magic blocks that do everything for you. Obsessive attention has been paid to make all the mods work together â€” no duplicate ores, no JEI entries that don't do anything or are uncraftable.

Here are a few things you can do:

- Build cool stuff with Create
- Do a little magic with Eidolon
- Want a map? Craft an atlas!
- Want to know what's around you? Craft a compass!
- Explore hundreds of gorgeous biomes thanks to Biome 'O Plenty
- Get a taste of Minecraft 1.18 with Caves and Cliffs Backport

This is very much a work-in-progress. Future additions will include more resource generation options, quests, and probably other stuff too :)
